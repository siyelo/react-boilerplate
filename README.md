React Boilerplate
=================

A basic kickstarter for React development using Browserify and Bower.

The aim is to be 'omakase'. With at least enough
flexibility for drop-in replacement of certain parts.

The boilerplate uses Gulp for watching and building.

Kickstart
---------

    npm install
    bower install
    gulp

Open your browser to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

Todo
----

- Is it ok to not check in build folders?
- Actually check that debowerify works.
- Test suite.
- More comments and documentation.
- Organised gulp tasks.
- Production builds.
- Configuration for external/vendored scripts?
